On the front right, the bumper cover sustains medium severity scuffing and scratching extending from the headlight down to the lower valance, which is gouged. This damage continues onto the front right wheel arch molding, which is deeply scratched, and the inner fender liner, which is shattered and detached. The front right alloy wheel also displays distinct curb rash. On the front left side, the bumper cover features abrasive scuffs below the headlight and a visible dent near the fog light housing. The left fog light bezel is slightly misaligned, and the lower bumper lip contains a structural crack or split at the bottom edge.",
