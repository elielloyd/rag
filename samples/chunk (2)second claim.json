    "merged_damage_description": "The vehicle presents damage concentrated on the rear bumper assembly, affecting both corners. The most severe damage is located on the rear right corner, where the lower textured plastic cladding has sustained a major impact resulting in a deep, concave dent. This deformation has collapsed the plastic structure, displaced the red reflector, warped the surrounding trim ribs, and left extensive surface scuffing. Directly above this area, the painted upper section of the rear right bumper exhibits distinct horizontal scratches and scuffs extending from below the tail light down to the cladding seam. Additionally, the rear left corner of the bumper shows minor damage, characterized by a cluster of diagonal surface abrasions and scuff marks on the unpainted textured plastic.",
